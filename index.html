        <p>
          Earlier this year (January 2018). I started to think about how I could
          improve my design skills and attract more customers. I wanted to start
          designing some ideas that for a long time I had only on paper and
          stored on my cell phone, I decided to look for some challenge,
          something that makes more sense with what I thought. I saw that many
          designers (especially in dribbble) made a daily user interface, I
          really liked the idea, but the problem was that the result was just
          something nice and did not solve any problem.

          <p>
            You will start seeing things differently and coming up with more

            By looking at problems from a different perspective, your ideas will

            Only when you experience a problem yourself do you understand the

          <p>
            As designers, we are often afraid of showing work that’s not
            finished or doesn’t look perfect. You will learn to accept feedback
            and learn from it.

          The challenge lasts 30 days. On each of those days you will have to

          result to the community.

              It has to be a problem that’s personally affecting or affected
              you, like finding your keys, calling a taxi or even remembering

              How can design help solve your problem? It's time to think about
